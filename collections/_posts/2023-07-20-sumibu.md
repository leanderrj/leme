*Caption: Discover SUMIBU's world of fashion and culture.*

Welcome to the world of **SUMIBU**, the Amsterdam-based clothing label founded in 2015 by the creative minds of Georgy Dendoe and Jordan Soediono. This unique brand draws its inspiration from a fusion of American and Japanese cultures, often represented as スミブ (*Sumibu* in Japanese characters).

### A Nostalgic Journey to Early 2000s Streetwear

At SUMIBU, our mission is to create timeless designs that evoke the nostalgic feeling of early 2000s streetwear fashion. We seamlessly blend Tokyo fashion aesthetics with the bold street style of New York, all interpreted through the lens of Amsterdam's vibrant youth culture.
