### Github Pages
This theme has been tested to work with Github Pages (and Github Project Pages). When using Github Pages you will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` otherwise all the css, images and paths will be broken.

For example the site https://zerostaticthemes.github.io/jekyll-atlantic-theme would have `baseurl: "/jekyll-atlantic-theme/"`
